# In-Depth Analysis

 The Tableau Analysis shows launch data from July 2013 to December 2013 for the CitiBike Program. After diving into the data, I was able to uncover several key phenomena based on my visualizations. According to the visulization concerning ride data based on time day, the most popular times for bike usage is 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. likely due to typical work hours. This chart also shows that rides steeply drop off in November in December, likely due to colder weather and snow. Due to the colder weather in this months it could be an idea to look into storing bikes in less popular as to not expose them to the harsh winter elements and avoid long-term wear and tear on the bikes. 
 
 Based on our membership data from the launch in 2013, the members seem to be overwhelmingly male. While membership peaked for both male and female rides in October, membership sharply declined going into November and December, again likely due to adverse weather conditions. Our data also shows that we have far more subscribers rather than customers signed up in 2013 which is good for long term data. 
 
 The last phenomena uncovered was found when analyzing users based on their birth year. I wanted to see if birth year had an effect on the number of trips, average trip duration, etc. It does seem their is a bit of a bell curve with the age of our users with the most popular age being around the age 33. The average trip duration also seems to level out at 15 minutes around age 60. However, there is no way currently to verify age so it might be best to implement some sort of fails-safe such a verifying with an ID.
